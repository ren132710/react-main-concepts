       * State and Component Lifecycle Overview
       * https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html
       *
       * Recap of what is going on in the code:
       * 1.
       * When <Clock /> is passed to root.render(), React calls the constructor of the Clock component.
       * Since Clock needs to display the current time, it initializes this.state with an object including the current time.
       * We will later update this state.
       * 2.
       * React then calls the Clock component’s render() method.
       * This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen.
       * React then updates the DOM to match the Clock’s render output.
       * 3.
       * When the Clock output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the componentDidMount() lifecycle hook.
       * Inside it, the Clock component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component’s tick() method once a second.
       * 4.
       * Every second the browser calls the tick() method.
       * Inside it, the Clock component schedules a UI update by calling setState() with an object containing the current time.
       * Thanks to the setState() call, React knows the state has changed, and calls render() method again to learn what should be on the screen.
       * This time, this.state.date in the render() method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time.
       * React updates the DOM accordingly.
       * 5.
       * If the Clock component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle hook so the timer is stopped.
       *
       * REMEMBER: Never modify state directly.
       * Wrong: this.state.comment = 'Hello';
       * Correct: this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});

      class Clock extends React.Component {
        /* old way required using a constructor */
        // constructor(props) {
        //   super(props)

        // }

        //1. initialize this.state with an object including the current time
        //this is the only time this.state should be directly assigned
        initialState = { date: new Date() }
        state = this.initialState

        //3. once Clock is inserted in the DOM, React calls componentDidMount()
        componentDidMount() {
          //component asks Browser to set up timer and call tick() function
          this.timerID = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000)
        }

        //5. if Clock is ever removed from the DOM, React calls componentWillUnmount()
        //so the timer is stopped
        componentWillUnmount() {
          clearInterval(this.timerID)

          )
        }

      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
