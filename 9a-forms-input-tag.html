       * Forms
       * https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html
       * In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select>
       * typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input.
       * In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of
       * components, and only updated with setState().
       *
       * We can combine the two by making the React state be the "single source of truth".
       * Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.
       * An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a "controlled component".
       *
       * Caveat
       * It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write
       * an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state
       * through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting
       * a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library
       *  In these situations, you might want to check out uncontrolled components,
       * an alternative technique for implementing input forms.
       */

      //Example controlled component: alerts() name every time Submit button is clicked
      //Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value
      //will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth.
      //Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state,
      //the displayed value will update as the user types.

      //With a controlled component, the input's value is always driven by the React state.
      //While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to
      //other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

          this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
          this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
        }

        handleChange(event) {
          this.setState({ value: event.target.value })
        }
        handleSubmit(event) {
          alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value)
          //prevent default behavior of form submission
          event.preventDefault()
        }

        render() {
